"""IMPORTANT:
We're using networkx only to provide a reliable graph
object.  Your solution may NOT rely on the networkx implementation of
any graph algorithms.  You can use the node/edge creation functions to
create test data, and you can access node lists, edge lists, adjacency
lists, etc. DO NOT turn in a solution that uses a networkx
implementation of a graph traversal algorithm, as doing so will result
in a score of 0.
